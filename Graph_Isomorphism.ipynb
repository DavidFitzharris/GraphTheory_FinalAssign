If we look at the example below, we can se isomorphism at work. While the structure of the graph is different, it is infact the same graph following the conditions of isomorphism. </p>\n",

    "<p>Looking at simple graphs, with a basic understanding of isomorphism you can relatively quickly figure out if these graphs are isomorphic or not. You can also draw bijections between the two graphs to establish if the graphs are the same, as mentioned above, looking for a one-to-one relationship between points. If the graphs were side by side, one point on the left would have to go to one point on the right. There does not have to be order but every point must go to only one other point with no points left, and follow the conditions that the number of components and edges are the same.<br><br> When graphs get a busier and more complex this no longer becomes such a simple task</p>\n",
