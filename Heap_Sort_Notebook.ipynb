    "<h2>What is Heap Sort?</h2>\n",
    "    <p>Heap sort is a comparison-based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure, where the min elemant is found, placed the beginning, and this process is repeated, or in reverse order(Min-heap or Max-Heap). It is one of the more popular and efficient sorting algorithms in programming and is favoured over other well known sorting algorithms such as bubble sort and merge sort.</p>\n",

    "<h2>Binary Tree and Heap</h2>\n",
    "<p> In a <b> rooted binary tree</b>, each node has at most two children, refered to as the left child and right child. The top element is known as the root note. These nodes are stored from left first  </p><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p><b>Binary Heap</b> is a complete binary tree where the nodes are ordered so the the parent node is greater value to the child nodes. The former is called max heap and the latter is called min heap. This can also be represented as an array.</p>\n",

    "<br> Using time in python we can check how long it takes to run each algorithm, or the runtime. Calculating the run time for the algorithms we can see how heap sort is sorting the array almost twice as fast The runtime for the bubble sort method takes 0.002 seconds while heap sort takes 0.001 seconds. This may seem very little with a small array, but when sorting through large quantities of data, and running programs efficiently, you can begin to understand the importance of using the more efficient sorting algorithm.</p>"
