# Graph Theory Assignment
## GMIT YR3

In this assignment we use jupyter notebook to create two notebooks looking into the areas of 'Heap-Sort' and 'The Graph Isomorphism Problem'. Jupyter notebooks alows us to quickly and easily create and share computational documents. It is a useful and easy to use tool that supports many languages, including Python which I am using here for code examples.

## Graph Isomorphism Problem

In this notebook we look at a few key areas as outlined by the assignment requirements:

• Definition of graph isomorphism.

• Specification of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.

• Python function to determine whether two graphs are isomorphic.

• Explanation of the main reason computer scientists are interested in the complexity of
the Graph Isomorphism Problem.


## Heap-Sort, A Sorting Algorithm

Here we look at some different sorting algorithms and methods, paying most attention to Heap-Sort

• Explanation of what a rooted binary tree is.

• Overview of how the heap sort algorithm works, with reference to trees.

• Python function implementing Heap Sort.

• Explanation why, in the worst case, heap sort is more efficient than bubble sort.

## Running in Jupyter Notebook

These notebooks are easily viewed here in github, but also can be cloned and used in Jupyter notebook.

To use jupyter notebook you will require the Anaconda and Jupyter:

Anaconda for windows, MacOS and Linux: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html

Jupyter installation or in browser: https://jupyter.org/

To start Jupyter notebook from your terminal, simply use the command - jupyter notebook
